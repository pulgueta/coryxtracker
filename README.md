# CoryxTracker

Simple API written in Hono + Bun deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Made to track how many days CoryxKenshin has been gone from YouTube.

## How it works

It uses the YouTube API to get the latest video from CoryxKenshin's channel and calculates the days since the video was uploaded after a day has passed of the upload.

Made just for **fun**.
